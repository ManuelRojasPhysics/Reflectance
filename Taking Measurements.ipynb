    "In order to measure several properties of materials, an optical set up can be used. This set up starts with a lamp which is shone through a lens, then through a semi reflective surface (Microscope slide used). The light then partially reflects on to the sample holder below which will reflect the light back up through the slide, in another lens which reconverges the light in to a detector, which then outputs data to the computer.

    "Once only the thin film data is left, fit using the following equation: $$R=A+Bcos(\\frac{4π}{\\lambda}*nd),$$ where the wavelength lambda is the independent variable. $D$ is the thickness of the thin film, $A$ is a vertical shift, and $B$ is the amplitude. The python notebook does all of this, however you need to add the text files, and indicate their file path at the beginning. To fit the model to the data, it is good practice to first plot a manual fit over the data to find good initial parameter guesses. Also determine what range you wish to fit within, avoid fitting to any data that is too noisy, or different from the range of interest. To get a numerical idea of the quality of the fit, the $R^2$ is calculated, the closer to $1$ the stronger the fit. If the fit fails, reconsider the range of data used, or change the initial guesses of the parameters. The main parameter we are interested in is $d$, meaning the real focus of the fit should be on the frequency, so if the amplitudes are a little bit off, that is not uncommon for this model as it ignores absorption. If desired a damping factor could be added to model to account for this. "
