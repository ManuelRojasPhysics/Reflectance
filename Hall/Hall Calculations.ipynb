    "This notebook aims to explain the calculations done by the hall system, which all stems from the slope of 8 Current vs Voltage plots. The following figures show a typical sample using the van der pauw method, and 2 possible switch orientations of the 8 which are cycled through. current will enter through two contacts, and voltage is measured across two other contacts. as current is ramped up, voltage is measured, the resulting line is then fitted, and the slope is the parameter of interest. We should have a zero y-intercept as zero current would result in zero voltage"
